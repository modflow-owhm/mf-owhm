# Version 2.3.1-b2  — Develop–Beta Release

&nbsp; 

The `develop` branch contains intermediate code and bug fixes for MODFLOW-OWHM. When the code is in a state that it compiles and passes the example tests, then a beta release is made and posted to the `beta` branch. These releases have NOT undergone USGS peer review and contain the preliminary disclaimer. The develop branch is stable and is eventually merged into the main branch for USGS code peer review. 

The `beta` branch is only for beta compiled executables, beta README.pdf, beta CHANGELOG.pdf, and it's source code from the develop branch. All other pdf documents are kept in their original markdown format. To read them either download a production release or view the markdown format on code.usgs.gov. 

Any commit stored on the `beta` branch may be dropped or rebased to save on online storage. Beta releases are not meant to be used in official publications, but are available to provide rapid release of bug fixes and new features for users to take advantage of. If a beta commit that you need is removed, then you can obtain the code it is based off of by finding in the `develop` branch a commit named `v2.X.Y-bZ`, where `X`, `Y`, and `Z` pertain to the beta version's minor, patch and beta numbers. For example, the commit `v2.3.1-b3`  would contain the code that was compiled to make the beta version 2.3.1-b3 (that is, the third beta release of version 2.3.1).

The web location for the `beta` and `develop` branches are:

### USGS Software Release Types

There are two types of [USGS Software releases](https://www.usgs.gov/about/organization/science-support/survey-manual/im-osqi-2019-01-review-and-approval-scientific):  

- Enterprise &ensp; ➣ &nbsp; Production&thinsp; Release
- Provisional &thinsp; ➢ &nbsp; Preliminary Release

The difference between the two release types are:

1. The `DISCLAIMER.md` 
   - The git commit will contain either the *Production Release* or *Preliminary Release* disclaimer.
   - Here is the current commit's [DISCLAIMER.md](DISCLAIMER.md)
   - The [USGS Software Disclaimers Section](#usgs-software-disclaimers) includes both disclaimers for comparison purposes.  
     &nbsp; 
1. The text file [code.json](#code.json) will contain the following line:
   - `"status": "Production"` &nbsp; for a *Production Release* and  
   - `"status": "Preliminary"` for a *Preliminary Release*  
      &nbsp; 
1. If the code version is registered in the USGS Information Product Data System (`IPDS`) and underwent colleague review.  
   ➥ A *Production Release* is registered in `IPDS` and includes a *git tag* with the message "production release".  
   Any other commit (or *git tag*) is considered a *Preliminary Release*.
    - All code changes, including bug fixes, start as a *Preliminary Release*;  
      when the code version is registered with `IPDS` it becomes a *Production Release*.
    - A *Production Release* and its associated *git tag* are stable and guaranteed to remain in the code.usgs.gov repository.
    - A *Preliminary Release* tag may be superseded by a *Production Release* with the same version number.  


> :warning: **Note that it is possible for a *Production Release* and *Preliminary Release* to have the same version number.**  
> &emsp;&emsp;That is, they are the same release but contain a different disclaimer in the `main` branch (source branch).  
> &emsp;&emsp;However, the *Production Release* supersedes a *Preliminary Release* in the `release` branch (executable branch) .

> :warning: **Contact a developer if you need to convert the current *Preliminary Release* tag to a *Production Release* tag.**  
> &emsp;&emsp;Some publication sources—particularly USGS Scientific Investigations Report (SIR)—can only cite a *Production Release*.

&nbsp; 

### Obtaining Code via Git

Please see the [Git Branches Section](#git-branches-and-organization) for an overview of the major branches in this repository.

To obtain this repository via git run: 

- `git clone  --no-tags  https://code.usgs.gov/modflow/mf-owhm.git`
  + The `--no-tags` flag is optional  
    it prevents the repo from downloading all the git release tags, which can make the `git log` messy.
  + [Git Large File Storage (LFS) ](https://git-lfs.github.com/) pointer files are used for executable binaries and example output.
  + By default only the `main` branch is unpacked. 
    + To view all the branches in the clone, run: `git branch --all` to see a list that might include:  
      `remotes/origin/BranchName`, and then to unpack it run: `git switch BranchName`

# Notes About Repository

## Markdown Files (.md)

[Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) (`.md`) files are placed throughout the repository to describe different aspects of the repo or provide general information. Markdown files are simple text files with some additional formatting for fast rendering in html. 

Viewing a markdown file in a text editor can be difficult to follow due to the additional formatting (especially viewing tables).
If you search for Markdown viewers you can find a number of tools that will render the final formatting of the `.md` files. 

The **[readme.txt](readme.txt)** file includes an overview on markdown formatting and includes a list of markdown viewers that can be downloaded.

## GMG Solver Information

MF-OWHM is written in Fortran (77, 95, 2003, and 2008) except the [Geometric Multigrid Solver (GMG)](https://pubs.usgs.gov/of/2004/1261/) is written in C. 

To provide an executable that is written only in Fortran, the default executable binary, `mf-owhm.exe`, 
<u>does not include the `GMG` solver</u>. Note the default binary does include the following solvers: `PCG`, `PCGN`, `SIP`, `DE4`, and `NWT`. 

For new models, it is recommended to use either the `PCGN` solver or `NWT` solver rather than `GMG`.

If your project does use the `GMG` solver, then use the executable binary named `mf-owhm-gmg.exe` instead. If you want to compile the binary yourself, then it is required to have both a Fortran and C compiler (e.g., `ifort` and `icc` or `gfortran` and `gcc`). To compile GMG use the provided `makefile` with the option `USEGMG = YES` or the Visual Studio Solution `OneWater_GMG_Project.sln`.

> :warning: ​Note that the [Downloads](#downloads) links include in the `bin` directory `mf-owhm.exe` and `mf-owhm-gmg.exe`. 

## Code Versioning

MF-OWHM follows a modified [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) system (`major.minor.patch`) . 

For example, version `12.34.5` is major version `12`, minor version `34`, and patch version `5`. 

Since major and minor versions rarely change, MF-OWHM informally calls a patch version a release number.  
For example, version `2.5.7`, is referred to as `Release 7` of version `2.5`.

For code in development-beta stages the patch number will contain a letter, starting with `a`, positioned after the patch version number. Each subsequent development/beta release will increase the letter by 1. 

For example, if version `2.5.7` is under development with bug fixes, it would be versioned as `2.5.8a`, `2.5.8b`, `2.5.8c`, and so forth until the final version `2.5.8` is complete. Then the letter process starts over again for `2.5.9a`.

Since versions with a post-pended letter are an intermediate product, these versions will not have a *git tag* associated to them. Using this letter designation is meant to provide a way to provide rapid code releases with small changes without exhausting version numbers. Particularly when fixing a bug that is necessary for a project, but is not significant enough to immediately warrant a patch number increase.

The chronological ordering of version numbers is the `major` version has the highest priority, then the `minor` version, then the `patch` version. The version numbers do not include zero padding, so the number between the decimal points should be interpreted as a single number.

Examples of newer versus older versions are:

- `11.9.7` is newer than `8.9.7`
- `8.9.7` is newer than `2.13.1` 
- `2.13.1` is newer than `2.5.12`
- `2.5.12` is newer than `2.5.7`
- `2.5.7` is newer than `2.5.7b` is newer than `2.5.7a` is newer than `2.5.6a`

&nbsp; 

## Code Versioning Citation

The version specified at the top of this `README.md` is part of the final software citation.
If there is a *git tag* or *GitLab Release*, then the tagname should match the `README.md` version number.

For example, the for a report that used version `2.7.69` should have the following citation: 

> Boyce, S.E., 2021, MODFLOW One-Water Hydrologic Flow Model (MF-OWHM) Conjunctive Use and Integrated Hydrologic Flow Modeling Software, version **2.7.69**: U.S. Geological Survey Software Release, https://doi.org/10.5066/P9P8I8GS

  

## Identifying the Code Version

The easiest way to identify the code version is to look at the `README.md` text file. On line 9 of the file you will  
see `# Version X.Y.Z`, where `X.Y.Z` is the version number. The USGS meta data file, `code.json`, also specifies  
the version number under the json record: `"version": "X.Y.Z"`.

If you only have a compiled executable binary, such a `mf-owhm.exe`, the version number is presented when running the program. The image below is a screenshot taken after starting the `mf-owhm.exe` program and underlines in red the code's version number (`X.Y.Z`). The figure also underlines in yellow the date that the version was released (`mm` is for month, `dd` is for day, and `yyyy` is for year). The part that is underline in indigo shows the modified version scheme that references only the major and minor versions (`X.Y`) and then calls the patch version a Release Number (`Z`).

&nbsp;

## Git Branches and Organization

The git repository for MF-OWHM will always contain the following branches:

1. `main` &emsp;&thinsp;&nbsp; ➢ &nbsp; Default branch with stable source code and no compiled binaries.
1. `release`&nbsp; ➢ &nbsp; *Preliminary/Production Release* of code and binaries for Windows (`.exe`) and Ubuntu Linux (`.nix`)
1. *Git Tags* that are pointers to specific versions (commits) of the code and compiled binaries.  
   &emsp;&ensp;The **[GitLab Releases Page](https://code.usgs.gov/modflow/mf-owhm/-/releases)** contains the important releases (that is, highlighting important git tags).  
   &emsp;&ensp;The **[GitLab Tags Page](https://code.usgs.gov/modflow/mf-owhm/-/tags)** contains a listing of all version tags in the repository (recommended for old version downloads).

There may be additional branches in the repository, but they are considered development-beta branches. The development-beta branches may or may not contain compiled executable binaries and are typically named `develop-feature` where `feature` is the name of the specific feature being added.

If a branch contains compiled executable binaries (`*.exe` and `*.nix` files), then they are placed in a `bin` directory.  
Note that there are multiple bin directories in this repository. 

Compiled executable binaries and the `examples/**/output-true` folders are stored using [Git Large File Storage (LFS)](https://git-lfs.github.com/). LFS is an open source Git extension that reduces the impact of large files stored in a git repository. Specifically, large files that are manage by LFS are downloaded during the `git checkout` (or `git switch`) process rather than during `git clone`, `git fetch`, or `git pull`. The USGS gitlab server, [code.usgs.gov](code.usgs.gov), includes a [GitLab Git LFS server](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/topics/git/lfs/), so all downloads will automatically handle the LFS operations. 

If you `git clone` this repository without Git LFS installed, then you will see a pointer file in the place of the compiled binaries. If Git LFS is installed, the pointer file is swapped automatically with the appropriate executable binary. 
Note that the windows installation of Git (https://git-scm.com/downloads) includes Git-LFS as part of the installation.

## Git Workflow

The general workflow for the branching model used here is:

- Create a `develop` type branch from the `main` branch &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;`main ⤇ develop`
- Once the `develop` branch is stable, submit a merge request to the `main` branch&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;`develop ⤇ main`
- Merge the `main` branch to the `release` branch and build the executable binaries&emsp;&ensp;&ensp;`main ⤇ release`

&nbsp; 

To convert code from a *Preliminary Release* to *Production Release*:

- Register the `release` branch version with the USGS Information Product Data System (`IPDS`)
- Change the `release` branch's `DISCLAIMER.md` to the *Production Release Disclaimer*.
- Make an annotated `git tag` that points to that `release` branch's commit that was approved.
  - The the *git tag* `<tagname>` should be the approved code version number.
  - For important releases the *git tag* may be targeted as a GitLab Release.
- The *git tag* now points to a *Production Release*.

&nbsp;

## code.usgs.gov GitLab Website

The official USGS git server (code.usgs.gov) uses the [GitLab Community Edition](https://about.gitlab.com/install/?version=ce) (CE) server software.  
This section presents some of the basics for website navigation and use of GitLab.

For the https://code.usgs.gov/modflow/mf-owhm website the default branch is the `main` branch.  
The default branch is what is automatically created when you run git clone and what you see when you first open the website. 

### GitLab Download Button

Throughout `code.usgs.gov` repositories there are download buttons that looks like: ![download_arrow](img/code-usgs-gov_page_download_arrow.png)

The download button—depending on where it is placed—can download the current commit shown on on the webpage (eg the `main` branch) , a specific folder in the repository, a specific file in the repository, or a *GitLab Tag*.

The download has four options for how to compress the download: `zip`, `tar.gz`, `tar.bz` and `tar`.  
It is recommended to use the `zip` download option.

The following image shows the pull down menu that appears when you click on the download button:

<p>
<img src="img/code-usgs-gov_page_download.png" alt="code-usgs-gov_page_download" width="40%" height="40%">
</p>

The "`Download source code`" downloads more than just the source code. It instead downloads a specific git commit, such as the `release` or `main`, or a specific *git tag*. Typically, the "`Download source code`" downloads the currently active commit on the website. For example, if the `release` branch is active on the website, then the download will include everything in the `release` branch, which includes the source code, compiled executable binaries, example problems, documentation, etc, etc, etc.

The "`Download this directory`" downloads what is currently being shown on the website.

### GitLab Branch Switching

The https://code.usgs.gov/modflow/mf-owhm website presents the `main` branch by default. 

On the main page there is a pull-down menu that allows the user to select any of the repository branches or git tags. When these branches or tags are selected the entire website changes to view that specific branch or tag (which also changes what the download button will download). The image below highlights in yellow the pull-down menu that is currently set to the `release` branch.



![header-code-usgs-gov](img/code-usgs-gov_page_header.png)



### GitLab Tags Page

A *GitLab Tag* entry is automatically created whenever a *git tag* commit pointer is created on `code.usgs.gov`. Most of the information on the GitLab Tags Page can be ignored. What is important are the *Tag Names*, which are the code version number that the tag points to. 

The following figure highlights the [GitLab Tags Page](https://code.usgs.gov/modflow/mf-owhm/-/tags), which can be accessed by moving the mouse to the *Left sidebar* of the website to the "Repository" header and then by clicking on the "Tags" header (see the indigo box in the image). 

The tag for version `2.0.0` has a green box around it to illustrate its location. To the far right of that tag name is the download button (indigo box) that will download that specific version of the repository (viz. MF-OWHM Version `2.0.0` ).

&nbsp;

![tags-1-code-usgs-gov](img/code-usgs-gov_tags-1.png)

&nbsp;

The download has four options for how to compress the download: `zip`, `tar.gz`, `tar.bz` and `tar`.  

The simplest one to pick is the `zip` option, which is illustrated below:

&nbsp;

![tags-2-code-usgs-gov](img/code-usgs-gov_tags-2.png)

&nbsp;

The structure of tagged urls follows a consistent pattern. The base url for a `.zip` download is always:

- code.usgs.gov/modflow/mf-owhm/-/archive/**TagName**/mf-owhm-**TagName**.zip

where **TagName** is replaced by the actual tag's name. 

For example, the url for the download of versions `2.0.3` is:

- code.usgs.gov/modflow/mf-owhm/-/archive/**2.0.3**/mf-owhm-**2.0.3**.zip

&nbsp;

### GitLab Releases Page

A *GitLab Releases* entry is created for important *git tag*s that require additional meta-data. Generally, it is best to either download the most current *Preliminary Release* from the [Downloads Section](#downloads) or search for a specific version in the *GitLab Tags* Page described in the previous section. However, if you want to only see major updates or have direct access to special uploads, then they will be placed in the *GitLab Releases* page. An entry in the *GitLab Releases* page is automatically made whenever a *git tag* includes release comments, but all this can be obtained directly from the GitLab Tags Page.

The following figure highlights in yellow where the *GitLab Releases* link is located. The "assets" are download links that download the *git tag* repository that the release was created from. For example, the `Version 2.0.0` "Source Code (zip)" download link downloads the *git tag* `2.0.0`, which be `code.usgs.gov/modflow/mf-owhm/-/archive/2.0.0/mf-owhm-2.0.0.zip`. (Note that this is the same url as the ones present the *GitLab Tags* page.) 

The "Other" under Assets, highlighted in green, contain additional download links to files that may not be in the repository and were needed by the release. In this example, the additional files added are the `mf-owhm.exe`, `mf-owhm-gmg.exe`, and the `Full Repository`. These additional downloads, may or may not be present, so it is recommend to instead use the [Downloads](#downloads) section located at the start of this readme or search for the version you want to download in the [GitLab Tags Page](https://code.usgs.gov/modflow/mf-owhm/-/tags). <p>
<img src="img/code-usgs-gov_releases.png" alt="release-code-usgs-gov" width="80%" height="80%">
</p>

&nbsp;

## Visual Studio IDE and Intel Fortran Setup

The windows executable binary is compiled using Microsoft Visual Studio 2019 (vs2019) integrated development environment (IDE) and Intel OneAPI's Fortran 2018 standard (`ifort`) and ANSI C (`icc`). The vs2019 solution is located in the `ide/visual_studio` directory. Please review the [Visual Studio and Intel Fortran Installation Guide](doc/Visual_Studio_and_Intel_Fortran_Installation_Guide.md) for information on how to install and use both programs. The visual studio solution (input file) for mf-owhm is located in the ide/visual_studio directory.

To assist in compilation and development of source code; however, a set of input files for different IDEs are provided. 

Note that the repository also includes a `makefile` that is written in [GNU Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) for compiling code directly (some of the IDEs use this makefile for their compilation process).

GNU gfortran is supported via a makefile, however the unit tests were completed using the Intel OneAPI compiler suite. 

&nbsp;

# Executive Summary

The U.S. Geological Survey’s MODFLOW One-Water Hydrologic Flow Model (MF-OWHM or OneWater) is a MODFLOW-based conjunctive use simulation software. The first version (Hanson et al., 2014) was selected by the World Bank Water Resource Software Review (Borden et al., 2016) as one of three recommended simulation programs for conjunctive use and management modeling. MF-OWHM builds upon the MODFLOW-2005 groundwater-flow simulation framework and multiple MODFLOW-2005 variants. This fusion of the MODFLOW-2005 variants and MF-OWHM specific enhancements allow for the following process-based simulations: saturated groundwater flow (three-dimensional); surface-water flow (one- and two-dimensional); landscape and irrigated agriculture; estimation of unknown agricultural irrigation and additional irrigation requirements for salinity flushing; reservoir operations and management; aquifer compaction and subsidence; seawater intrusion by a sharp-interface assumption; karst-aquifer and fractured-bedrock flow; and vertical unsaturated groundwater flow (one-dimensional).

A Ground-Water Flow Model (MODFLOW-2005) is a computer program that simulates through finite differences the groundwater-flow equation (Harbaugh, 2005). The MODFLOW-2005 framework employed a modular design that allows for the easy development and incorporation of new features called packages and processes that communicate with the groundwater flow equation. Packages are code features that relate to the groundwater-flow process, e.g. subsidence; a process may solve a separate flow equation or represent a non-groundwater-related process, e.g. surface-water routing. With the development of new packages and processes, the MODFLOW-2005 base framework began to diverge into multiple independent versions designed for specific simulation needs. This divergence limited each independent MODFLOW release to its specific designed purpose, such that there was no longer a single, comprehensive, general-purpose hydraulic-simulation framework. MF-OWHM is an integrated hydrologic flow model that “integrates” into one cohesive simulation software multiple MODFLOW-2005 variants; enhancements were added that take advantage of multiple capabilities within one code. This enhanced fusion of MODFLOW-2005 versions resulted in a simulation software capable of addressing and understanding a diverse type of conjunctive-use, water-management, water-food-security, and climate-crop-water scenario analyses. 

While maintaining compatibility with existing MODFLOW-2005 versions, MF-OWHM includes:

- Process-based simulation that includes:
   - Saturated groundwater flow (three-dimensional)
   - Surface water flow (one- and two-dimensional)
       -  Stream and river flow
       -  Lake and reservoir storage 
   - Landscape simulation and irrigated agriculture 
     -  Land-use and crop simulation
     -  Root uptake of groundwater
     -  Precipitation
     -  Actual evapotranspiration
     -  Runoff 
     -  Infiltration
     -  Estimated irrigation demand
   - Reservoir operations
   - Aquifer compaction and subsidence with vertical model-grid deformation
   - Seawater intrusion with a sharp-interface assumption
   - Karst-aquifer and fractured-bedrock flow
   - Turbulent and laminar-pipe network flow
   - Unsaturated groundwater flow (one-dimensional)
- Internal linkages between the processes that couple hydraulic head, flow, and deformation,
- Facilitation of the self-updating-model concept (making it easy to maintain models),
- Additional observation, scale factors, and parameter options for advanced calibration,
- An interpretive computer language, S-Language, for constructing custom command sets for reservoir-operation rules and decision trees.

MF-OWHM is a MODFLOW-2005 based integrated hydrologic model (IHM) that allows for the simulation, analysis, and evaluation of management options from nearly all components of human and natural water movement through a physically-based supply-and-demand framework. The term integrated, in the context of this report, refers to the tight coupling of groundwater flow, surface-water flow, landscape processes, aquifer compaction and subsidence, reservoir operations, and conduit/karst flow. 

Another benefit of this IHM is that models developed to run with MODFLOW-2005, MODFLOW-NWT, MODFLOW-CFP, or MODFLOW-FMP can also be simulated with MF-OWHM. However, the current release of MF-OWHM does not include a direct, internal simulation of snowmelt; advanced mountainous-watershed rainfall-runoff simulation; detailed, shallow soil-moisture accounting; or atmospheric moisture content. Atmospheric moisture may be accounted for indirectly by, optionally, specifying a pan evaporation rate, reference evapotranspiration, and precipitation. These features are currently not included to ensure that simulation runtime remains small enough to enable automated methods of calibrating model parameters to field observations, which typically require a large number of model runs. The MF-OWHM philosophy is to include as detailed hydrological processes as possible, so long as simulation run times remain reasonable enough to allow for robust parameter estimation and model calibration. 

To represent both natural and human-influenced flow, MF-OWHM integrates physically-based flow processes—derived from MODFLOW-2005—into a supply and demand framework. The model simulates and tracks the movement and use of groundwater, surface water, precipitation, and imported water supply that meets the consumptive demands from irrigated and non-irrigated agriculture, natural vegetation, and urban water uses. Water consumption is determined by balancing the available water supply with water demand, leading to the concept of a demand-driven, supply-constrained simulation.  

The MF-OWHM Supply-and-Demand Framework is especially useful for the analysis of agricultural water use, where there is often a paucity of available data describing land-use changes over time, such as crop type and distribution, and associated groundwater pumpage. For example, MF-OWHM provides the option to automatically increase groundwater irrigation pumping, which often is unknown, to meet the residual demand after all sources of water supply have been exhausted in a particular region. Supply and demand regions are simulated in the software as Water Balance Subregions (WBS).

To achieve the physically-based supply and demand framework, the MODFLOW-2005 philosophy of no inter-package and -process communication was relaxed for MF-OWHM. Traditional MODFLOW simulation models required that all packages and processes communicate (i.e. the movement of water) either through the groundwater-flow equation or through the removal of water from the simulation domain. For example, the MODFLOW-2005 representation of a groundwater well extracts water by subtracting from the groundwater-flow equation and removes it from the simulation domain. This feature is available within the MF-OWHM Framework, but options were added to allow the user to specify a particular a use or destination of pumped groundwater within the model domain (e.g., irrigation, managed aquifer recharge, return-flow to streams). 

This repository contains the source code for MF-OWHM and compiled windows binary.

# USGS Software Disclaimers

As described in the [USGS Software Release Types section](#usgs-software-release-types) there code.usgs.gov have two different release types (*Production Release* and *Preliminary Release*). One of the key differences between the two release types is the text in the `DISCLAIMER.md` file.

The following is the text that is included in the two disclaimer types.

**Production Release Disclaimer**

> This software has been approved for release by the U.S. Geological Survey  
> (USGS). Although the software has been subjected to rigorous review, the USGS  
> reserves the right to update the software as needed pursuant to further analysis  
> and review.
>
> No warranty, expressed or implied, is made by the USGS or the U.S. Government  
> as to the functionality of the software and related material nor shall the  
> fact of release constitute any such warranty.
>
> Furthermore, the software is released on condition that neither the USGS nor  
> the U.S. Government shall be held liable for any damages resulting from its  
> authorized or unauthorized use.

&nbsp;

**Preliminary Release Disclaimer**

> This software is preliminary or provisional and is subject to revision. It is  
> being provided to meet the need for timely best science. The software has not  
> received final approval by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS). 
>
