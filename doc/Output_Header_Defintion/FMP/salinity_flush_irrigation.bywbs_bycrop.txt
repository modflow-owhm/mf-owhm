PRINT ByWBS_ByCrop Output file from FMP SALINITY_FLUSH_IRRIGATION Block


The keyword PRINT ByWBS_ByCrop writes to the Generic_Output_OptKey file the summarized salinity irrigation flush
results for each WBS for every time. The keyword PRINT ByWBS has the same headers, except it does not include the CROP header because it aggregates all crops together by WBS. The keyword PRINT ByCrop has the same headers, except it does not include the WBS header because it aggregates information across all WBSs for each crop. The keyword PRINT ByCrop has the same headers, except it is written for every model cell and contains the header ROW and COL, for the model row and column, after the header FARM.


Writes for each time step salinity irrigation flush demand and flows sumarized
for each Water Balance Subregion (WBS) and for each land use (crop).

The output may be text or binary format.

If the output file is text format, then it will contain a single header line
followed by the output written for each time step. If the output file is binary format,
then each times step writes a binary record containing only the output data.

Date output is formatted using ISO 8601-1:2019 standard without a time zone designation:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601#Combined_date_and_time_representations

The general format is:
yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ss
                   where:
                         yyyy is the four digit Gregorian year
                         mm   before the T is the two digit month number       (01 to 12)
                         dd   is the two digit day of the month                (01 to {28, 29, 30, 31}, depending on the month)
                         T    calendar date and 24-hour clock time separator
                         hh   is the hour within the day                       (00 to 23 hour)
                         mm   after the T is the two digit minutes in the hour (00 to 59 minute)
                         ss   is the two digit seconds of the minute           (00 to 59 second)

Output is in model units that uses an
   L as a place holder for Length, L2 is for area, L3 is for volume and
   T as a place holder for Time

which are defined in the DIS package as being:
   L: Feet, Meters, Centimeters, and Undefined
   T: Seconds, Minutes, Hours, Days, Years, and Undefined

The MODFLOW-OWHM standard binary formatting is set to
Fortran Unformatted Stream (C style binary).

The description of each header indicates the Fortran variable
that is used to write the binary recorded.

The following explain their storage use:
